# Getting started
1. First download a text editor to your liking. I personally use Sublime Text. Which you can download at https://www.sublimetext.com/.

2. Download this repository for the basic folder structure and materials such as images. 

3. Start with the basic html structure. You can find an html template at https://www.w3schools.com/html/. 

4. Double click on the index.html in order to open the webpage with your favourite browser (although ideally you use Google Chrome).

5. See a live example [here](https://gijslebesque.github.io/)
